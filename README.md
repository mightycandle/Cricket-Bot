# Cricket-Bot
The aim of this project is to build a small scale robot that can hit the ball without human intervention by including Computer vision techniques to see when and how the ball is coming towards the bat.
The bot enables motion in two directions, X-direction offset to align with the ball and Z-direction motion to hit the ball when the it approaches the bat.
